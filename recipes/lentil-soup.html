    <h2>Honestly, the best lentil soup I've ever had!</h2>
    <p>Whether you’re looking to lighten up your meals or warm up with a steaming bowl of soup, 
        this healthy lentil soup recipe is for you! It’s one of my all-time favorites and I hope 
        it becomes a staple in your kitchen as well.</p>

    <p>This recipe is easy to make and tates delicious. With over 2,000 5-star reviews, it sounds like 
        other peole have loved it as well. I also made this recipe in mind with items that are typically in stock
        in a vegetarian's pantry. I wanted to keep people from having to run to the store for every new 
        recipe they come across.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4c extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow or white onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, pressed or minced</li>
        <li>2 tsp. ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp. curry powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 large can (28oz.) diced tomatoes, lightly drained</li>
        <li>1c brown or green lentils, picked over and rinsed</li>
        <li>4c vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2c water</li>
        <li>1tsp salt</li>
        <li>pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1c chopped fresh collard greens or kale, ribs removed</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <H3>Steps</H3>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat. 1/4c olive oil
            may seem like a lot, but it adds a lovely richness and heartiness to the nutritious soup.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion and carrot and cook, stirring often,
            until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, cumin, curry powder and thyme. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, 
            about 30 seconds. Pour in the drained diced tomatoes and cook for a few more minutes, stirring 
            often, in order to enhance their flavor.</li>
        <li>Pour in the lentils, broth and the water. Add 1 teaspoon salt and a pinch of red pepper flakes. 
            Season generously with freshly ground black pepper. Raise heat and bring the mixture to a boil, 
            then partially cover the pot and reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for 25 to 30 
            minutes, or until the lentils are tender but still hold their shape.</li>
        <li>Transfer 2 cups of the soup to a blender. Securely fasten the lid, protect your hand from steam 
            with a tea towel placed over the lid, and purée the soup until smooth. Pour the puréed soup back 
            into the pot. (Or, use an immersion blender to blend a portion of the soup.)</li>
        <li>GrAdd the chopped greens and cook for 5 more minutes, or until the greens have softened to 
            your liking. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Taste and 
            season with more salt, pepper and/or lemon juice until the flavors really sing. For spicier 
            soup, add another pinch or two of red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Serve while hot. Leftovers will keep well for about 4 days in the refrigerator, or can be frozen 
            for several months. (Just defrost before serving)</li>
